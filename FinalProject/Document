Section 1. Project Title and Overview
 My project for the Introduction to Robotics Course 2019-2020 is essentially a hand gesture controlled car . Basically , as the name 
suggests , it's a vehicle controlled by wearing a glove . Controls are as simple as left,right,forward,backward and stop . All is
achieved by wrist movement.

Section 2. Purpose and Need
 Obviously the project is stricly for entertainment purposes . Without a doubt it is extremelly fun to goof around with the controls /
movement of the car , just by waving your hand in the directions mentioned above .
 The project is still in an early phase . It can definitely be developed in so many fields of expertise . Just the core idea of remote 
 control by hand gestures can be possibly implemented in the prosthetics industry.
 
Section 3. Implementation Method
 -Design the chasis for the car ( length , width , material ) . Take into consideration every little aspect like weight of the material
 malleability , strength and cost . 
 -Determine which components you are going to use . Example: drivers , dc motors , arduino boards etc.
 -From here on , the projects splits into 2 parts : The Receiver and The Transmitter .
 -The transmitter will be the glove and the receiver will be the car . The transmitter wil contain a gyroscope which will measure the 
 X and Y axis (for the time being) . Based on the measurements which we'll send via radio , we change the direction of the motors.
 --Transmitter : For the glove , I have sewed the arduino uno board through the bonds . To the arduino , I have connected the gyroscope
 which i've placed in the back of the hand . (It's important to position it extremelly well in order for the movements to feel natural)
 Besides the gyroscope , I've also connected a radio module ( NRF24L01 + PA + LNA <-> NRF24L01 with antenna ) . Placement of the module
 is not relevant . The range exceeds easily 100 m .
 --Receiver : I started out by experimenting with the motor driver shields . ( You can either choose between l293d shield or l298n shield
 - depends on how you want the layout to be ) . I strongly recommend the 293d as it offers a wider range of appliances . Example : 4 
 motor drivers slots - via screw terminal compared to only 2(l298d) .It is easier to use thanks to the 2 drivers & shift register 
 embedded in the shield.
 --Furthermore , the DC Motors play a key role . IMPORTANT : Choose them accordingly based on speed , traction and haulage (in my case
 i decided to use the micro motor ga12-n20 with 10 mm long shaft and 42 mm rubber wheels ). After connecting them properly ,do not forget
 to establish the radio connection . 
 
Section 4. Radio Connection
To establish the radio connection , you need to connect the wires to the proper pins of the Arduino . 
The NRF24L01 module pins are:
GND is the Ground Pin. It is usually marked by encasing the pin in a square so it can be used as a reference for identifying 
the other pins.
VCC supplies power for the module. This can be anywhere from 1.9 to 3.9 volts. You can connect it to 3.3V output from your Arduino.
Remember connecting it to 5V pin will likely destroy your nRF24L01+ module!
CE (Chip Enable) is an active-HIGH pin. When selected the nRF24L01 will either transmit or receive, depending upon which mode it is
currently in.
CSN (Chip Select Not) is an active-LOW pin and is normally kept HIGH. When this pin goes low, the nRF24L01 begins listening on
its SPI port for data and processes it accordingly.
SCK (Serial Clock) accepts clock pulses provided by the SPI bus Master.
MOSI (Master Out Slave In) is SPI input to the nRF24L01.
MISO (Master In Slave Out) is SPI output from the nRF24L01.
IRQ is an interrupt pin that can alert the master when new data is available to process.(Connection not required)
So , for the Arduino Mega the SPI pins are :	51(MOSI)	50(MISO)	52(SCK)
For the Arduino Uno & Nano: 11(MOSI) 12(MISO) 13(SCK)

Section 5. Requirements
-Jumper Wires
-Motor Driver Shield l293d
-2 Arduino boards ( I used for the receiver an Arduino Mega2560 and for the transmitter an Arduino Uno ) - The setup can be easily done
with 2 Arduino Nano if you decide to use 2 layers 1 oz HASL surface finish 1.6 mm Thickness Designed PCB board 
-Wheels(6 * 42 mm Rubber Wheels) - depends on your layout
-DC Motors ( 6 * Micro Motor Ga12-N20 with high reductor )
-2 NRF24L01 + PA + LNA for the receiver and transmitter
-Gy 521 Gyroscope
-2 * 18650 li-ion battery (450mA Li-po battery)
-2 * Battery Holder
-Glove (any kind )
-Chasis for the car ( Acrylic sheet , Hobbyglas or Plexiglas) - Material of choice

Section 6. Libraries used
Arduino Basic Spi library
Wire
NRF24L01 header file
The TMRh20 RF24 library
AFMotor - most recent one

Section 7. Unforeseen Problems
-The DC Motors can't overcome the weight of the car
-The NRF24L01 module (the simple one ) may not work , even though you try 6 or 7 . Just stick around /w the PA+LNA one.(Thanks Ivona)
-Properly connect the jumper wires to the screw terminals or the car will not work accordingly.
-Use a charged battery powerful enough
-Fix the motors in place (Screws preferably) . Hot Glue is an alternative but not for long term . 
-Make sure to place the motors straight . Even the slightest tilt we'll make the car not follow the original course and will provide
more friction , which means less speed & traction.
-Use the proper libraries
