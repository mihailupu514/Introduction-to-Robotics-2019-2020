Here we shall post the homeworks.If only we did them when required :)


RGBPotentiometer
1 RGB Led
3 potentiometers
Connection cable
Arduino Uno
Jumper Wires
220 ohm resistors

We use the 3 potentiometers to change the value of each coler . Based on the values we can recreate colors like violet , yellow ,white etc. , besides the standard Red , Green , Blue


Knock Buzzer
Passive Buzzer
Active Buzzer
1 5.1 V Diode
1Mega ohm resistor
1 Button
Jumper Wires
Red Led


We use the passive buzzer to detect the knock . When the knock was registered , the led lights up and after 5 seconds , the active buzzer plays a note .
